               How badly I wish if I could tell you this, looking straight into your eyes. This is my true story. Take every word seriously!Lets look at the greener side of the grass.My father is 52 and mother is 48. NO ONE can guess their correct age. They have won many prizes in our society parties such as &quot;best couple of the year&quot; , &quot;made for each other&quot; , &quot;compatible couple&quot; and bull shit!They are too sexy, too good looking, some random person cannot acknowledge the fact that they have a 22 year old daughter( unfortunately, its me). My mom looks of early 30's and dad early 40's. My dad has won many awards for his great accomplishment in his job. He is the best shrewd person I've ever met. His friends take his advice before taking any big step(like business). My mom is a great cook and superb home maker. I always tell her to try for Mrs. India title(she's that beautiful..lean and tall and fair). Now lets come inside our house and see the grey part. They both don't talk to each other like a normal husband wife do. Just the formal inquiries( &quot;do you want to eat?&quot;,&quot; we have to go for this party&quot;, &quot;did any one call on the landline?&quot;). My dad bitches about my mother all the time(with me). I pretend not to listen and change the topic. All my mom cares about is her looks, therapies, gym, parlor(not like typical page 3 ladies, but yes little bit). I have never experienced three of us sitting together having a good 'healthy' chit-chat, laughing and sharing our experiences. My mom and dad do not sleep in the same room, mom sleeps in guest room, dad in the master bed room. They do not share their emotions and sadness and worries. Dude, providing for your family is one thing, and giving your time and maintaining a good environment in your house is another. It is suffocating in this house, dirty politics played within your family. Witnessing all this I don't ever want to get married. EVER! My parent's good friends think they are the perfect couple. THEY ARE NOT! I KNOW HOW BAD IT IS!!!!Sweetheart listen, looks and personality, it is for society and friends and it lasts only for the parties. But after you come back home what you will deal with is their heart, their way of thinking, their nature, that humanity, that goodness! Stop thinking about others, because end of the day when you come back home, you have to deal with her, not your mom and society! Kids, you want good looking spoiled kids who wont take your care after you get old, or a kid who is not that good looking but has a heart like her mother!

               Answering an anon because my partner is on Quora. When we started dating, there were a lot of my friends who did not want me to date him because he is not as good looking as me. But all of them always agreed he is a sweet and caring man. In all honesty, I never fell for his looks, but for his intelligence, compassion and an absolutely unparalleled sense of humour! And as for our achievements, we both have helped each other climb ladders and achieve things! He has the capability to lighten up my mood when I am extremely sad. And as for looks, if you love somebody you find them beautiful. Today, I wouldn't trade kissing his lips for another pair of lips. Okay, even if our kids aren't the prettiest ones around, I know that they will be one of the kindest and smartest ones around.<br />Do you want your partner to be compassionate or just pretty? Pretty dies off with age. Compassion increases with age.

               Looks don't matter at all. Boring conversations and bad sex are far worse than bad looks.

               Leave your partner before she starts feeling ashamed of you.

               Its very similar to my case with a huge exception. I am average looking where as my partner is very very good looking. Wherever we go he definetly standout.But for him i am the most beautiful girl! When we wake up in the morning he says &quot; Good morning beautiful!&quot;.that completely kick starts my day feeling awesome! I love it.Looks are same as materialistic. It doesnt last forever. Loses its face value! You age you, get wrinkles and everybody will stop appreciating your looks. What people remember are, how you made them feel. It either makes them strong or leaves a scar. Especially with your loved ones. Start to appreciate your partner in small ways and slowly your perception on looks will fade away. I have seen great looking couples hating each other, thus making them look ugly. On the contrast odd looking couple sharing an amazing chemistry!So stop making yourself ugly with narrow thoughts. Your partner deserves the best. If you cant give it, leave your partner so she/he can have good life without feeling shallow of having you.
