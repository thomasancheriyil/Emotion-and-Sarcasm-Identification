               How badly I wish if I could tell you this, looking straight into your eyes. This is my true story. Take every word seriously!Lets look at the greener side of the grass.My father is 52 and mother is 48. NO ONE can guess their correct age. They have won many prizes in our society parties such as &quot;best couple of the year&quot; , &quot;made for each other&quot; , &quot;compatible couple&quot; and bull shit!They are too sexy, too good looking, some random person cannot acknowledge the fact that they have a 22 year old daughter( unfortunately, its me). My mom looks of early 30's and dad early 40's. My dad has won many awards for his great accomplishment in his job. He is the best shrewd person I've ever met. His friends take his advice before taking any big step(like business). My mom is a great cook and superb home maker. I always tell her to try for Mrs. India title(she's that beautiful..lean and tall and fair). Now lets come inside our house and see the grey part. They both don't talk to each other like a normal husband wife do. Just the formal inquiries( &quot;do you want to eat?&quot;,&quot; we have to go for this party&quot;, &quot;did any one call on the landline?&quot;). My dad bitches about my mother all the time(with me). I pretend not to listen and change the topic. All my mom cares about is her looks, therapies, gym, parlor(not like typical page 3 ladies, but yes little bit). I have never experienced three of us sitting together having a good 'healthy' chit-chat, laughing and sharing our experiences. My mom and dad do not sleep in the same room, mom sleeps in guest room, dad in the master bed room. They do not share their emotions and sadness and worries. Dude, providing for your family is one thing, and giving your time and maintaining a good environment in your house is another. It is suffocating in this house, dirty politics played within your family. Witnessing all this I don't ever want to get married. EVER! My parent's good friends think they are the perfect couple. THEY ARE NOT! I KNOW HOW BAD IT IS!!!!Sweetheart listen, looks and personality, it is for society and friends and it lasts only for the parties. But after you come back home what you will deal with is their heart, their way of thinking, their nature, that humanity, that goodness! Stop thinking about others, because end of the day when you come back home, you have to deal with her, not your mom and society! Kids, you want good looking spoiled kids who wont take your care after you get old, or a kid who is not that good looking but has a heart like her mother!

               Candidate?&nbsp;Who told you the whole World revolves around you, mate? Is this some sort of dream job interview where only the other party (candidate) is supposed to have the so-called merits like &quot;Good Looks&quot;, education, etc. so that the heavens smile down upon them and Behold! They get to marry you.&nbsp;How would you like it if your would-be wife felt ashamed of you because of some aspect of your personality which is ironically out of your control?&nbsp;Marriage is a Union. It's team-work. It's let's-do-this-together. It's Honey-could-you-pick-up-my-dry-cleaning-on-the-way-home. It's could-you-take-a-day-off-to-cheer-me-up. It's We-had-a-miscarriage. It's We-had-a-kid-and-now-we-are-clueless-about-how-to-raise-them. It's We-are-broke.&nbsp; (Notice the WE)&nbsp;Good-looking kids? Bloody ridiculous. I have friends who are absolutely gorgeous and only one of their parents is great looking and the other one (The Mom, actually) is not. Or both the parents are pretty and &quot;fair&quot; (ahem, ahem) but the kids are below-average looking (thanks to their plain looking ancestors).&nbsp;It is good you realize that your perspective of looking at your partner is shallow and superficial.&nbsp;Now, I will answer your question. How to overcome this feeling.&nbsp;1. By genuinely taking an interest in your partner. Notice what she says, when she says it, how she reacts to things. What she likes, what makes her smile, what hurts her. What are her hobbies. Take active interest in your would-be wife. &nbsp;She will be the half of your life. She is the constant witness to all your struggles, your big moments, your pay hikes, your parents dying, your every gooddamn day <i><u>for the rest of your life</i></b>. &nbsp;2. Put yourself in her shoes. Be completely honest - would you like to marry you? &nbsp;Notice her, friend. If you still feel ashamed, reject her and look for someone who is conventionally good-looking. Trust me, you will be doing her the favour of a life-time.

               Leave your partner before she starts feeling ashamed of you.

               Looks don't matter at all. Boring conversations and bad sex are far worse than bad looks.

               Answering an anon because my partner is on Quora. When we started dating, there were a lot of my friends who did not want me to date him because he is not as good looking as me. But all of them always agreed he is a sweet and caring man. In all honesty, I never fell for his looks, but for his intelligence, compassion and an absolutely unparalleled sense of humour! And as for our achievements, we both have helped each other climb ladders and achieve things! He has the capability to lighten up my mood when I am extremely sad. And as for looks, if you love somebody you find them beautiful. Today, I wouldn't trade kissing his lips for another pair of lips. Okay, even if our kids aren't the prettiest ones around, I know that they will be one of the kindest and smartest ones around.<br />Do you want your partner to be compassionate or just pretty? Pretty dies off with age. Compassion increases with age.
