               How badly I wish if I could tell you this, looking straight into your eyes. This is my true story. Take every word seriously!Lets look at the greener side of the grass.My father is 52 and mother is 48. NO ONE can guess their correct age. They have won many prizes in our society parties such as &quot;best couple of the year&quot; , &quot;made for each other&quot; , &quot;compatible couple&quot; and bull shit!

               Leave your partner before she starts feeling ashamed of you.

               Looks don't matter at all. Boring conversations and bad sex are far worse than bad looks.

               Candidate?&nbsp;Who told you the whole World revolves around you, mate? Is this some sort of dream job interview where only the other party (candidate) is supposed to have the so-called merits like &quot;Good Looks&quot;, education, etc. so that the heavens smile down upon them and Behold! They get to marry you.&nbsp;How would you like it if your would-be wife felt ashamed of you because of some aspect of your personality which is ironically out of your control?&nbsp;Marriage is a Union. It's team-work. It's let's-do-this-together. It's Honey-could-you-pick-up-my-dry-cleaning-on-the-way-home. It's could-you-take-a-day-off-to-cheer-me-up. It's We-had-a-miscarriage. It's We-had-a-kid-and-now-we-are-clueless-about-how-to-raise-them. It's We-are-broke.&nbsp; (Notice the WE)&nbsp;Good-looking kids? Bloody ridiculous. I have friends who are absolutely gorgeous and only one of their parents is great looking and the other one (The Mom, actually) is not.

               Mr. New George clooney , first you are engaged to girl your mother picked secondly you are worried when you've picked up on your's mom's anxiety that your children will not be so great looking either (it's ridiculous, you know. It 's so&nbsp; funny to me). Why not select from Miss Universe or Earth participants?
