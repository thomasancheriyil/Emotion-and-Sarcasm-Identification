Pressing the elevator button thrice makes it go in hurry mode.

I work 40 hours a week to be this poor.

The cubicle is a padded cell without a door.

I started out with nothing and still have most of it left.

I will try being nice if you try being smarter.

I see that you have set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.

I overestimated the number of your brain cells.
