I get a text at 3 a.m. on July 29th. He asked me if I was a virgin. I really did not know where that came from, but I was scared. However, I gathered my courage and replied. He  did not reply. He started picking my calls, but never spoke  wholeheartedly. Even upon repeated questioning, he never told me the reason  for his behaviour. I was really depressed and worried.
