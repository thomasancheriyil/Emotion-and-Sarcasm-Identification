               I was third to last in a marathon of about 2000 runners. I came in less than 3 minutes under the maximum time. I got the medal. And I beat about 6 billion people who have never run a marathon.

               Yeah, totally.Because each woman in India can be generalised into a single category, wherein each has similar tastes and sense of humour. All Indian women have a terrible sense of humour and thus hate sarcasm. None of them find Chandler Bing hot. And this cannot be a sarcastic answer, because I am an Indian woman.

               Ab DeVillers has a chance to be the greatest batsman who made his debut in the new millennium. Any other sort of elevation, in addition to being premature, would be a gross exaggeration. He is, however, the most innovative shot player I have seen.

               The Internet erupted in an energetic debate yesterday about whether an ugly dress was blue and black or white and gold, with celebrities weighing in. It  sounds inane, but the dress question was actually tricky: Some declared  themselves firmly in the blue and black camp, only to have the dress  appear white and gold when they looked back a few hours later. These kind of notifications annoy me the most. I don't see a point.

               I get a text at 3 a.m. on July 29th. He asked me if I was a virgin. I really did not know where that came from, but I was scared. However, I gathered my courage and replied. He  did not reply. He started picking my calls, but never spoke  wholeheartedly. Even upon repeated questioning, he never told me the reason  for his behaviour. I was really depressed and worried.
