               Yeah, totally.Because each woman in India can be generalised into a single category, wherein each has similar tastes and sense of humour. All Indian women have a terrible sense of humour and thus hate sarcasm. None of them find Chandler Bing hot. And this cannot be a sarcastic answer, because I am an Indian woman.
